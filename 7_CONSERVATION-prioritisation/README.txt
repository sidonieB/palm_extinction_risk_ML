The TDWG folder necessary for some parts of the plotting (maps) was not uploaded in Github because it is too heavy.
Similarly, 6 files are also missing (phylogenies, phylogenetic and functional distance matrices) because they were too heavy to be uploaded.
Do not hesitate to contact the author Sidonie Bellot (s.bellot@kew.org) to ask for the files.
